The way to run the program: 

First move the test file to the Ferry_crossing folder, the same level with the src folder. For example, if the test file is test.txt, then the directory of it is Ferry_crossing/test.txt. (Note that the test file format best be txt file.) 

Then open the Ferry_crossing.java file and find the main function. Inside the main function, the second line of code is “demo.readFile(“input.txt”). Change the file name to be the same as the file you move in the previous step.  

Finally, run the Ferry_crossing.java and the output will be displayed in the console.
